 Report:
 		  First, I would like to acknowledge and thank the tutoring and assistance provided to me to complete this assignment.
 		It took a few tries to understand how to manipulate the rgb bytes that were read by data[row][col].
		Calling methods to execute a command is still a weak point of mine.		
		  Image manipulations other than the ones stated on the project requirements are not included in this project.
		Overall, this project was good in tying up all the things we learned over the course of this class: creating methods, using arrays,
		mathematical manipulations... It was also a good project to help understand coordinating multi-file projects.
			The project is a good end to this class. Thank you.
